# THIS APPLICATION NEEDS TO BE TESTED ON AN ACTUAL CELLPHONE, NOT AN EMULATOR.
* In an emulator it works, but the throws are so "weak" it will start again and again since the wait time between throws correlates with the throwing distance, so you will be really annoyed by the sound. 
* The application works for one throw, after that you need to restart the app for another throw.
The reason is that no matter how we tried to clear the array with accelerator readings, it results in an error.
